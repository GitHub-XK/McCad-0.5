 + McCadPrintUsage.h

McCadConvertTools_Convertor
 - all read/write responsibilities for files
 - GetDecomposedSolid() was redundant
 - wok files .ixx, .jxx

McCadConvertTools_Expander
 - file IO
 - dependencies on TKMcCadEXPlug

- McCadConvertTools_Merger: moved to McCadIOHelper_Merger

McCadConvertTools_VoidGenerator
 ! fixed localization bug in ::Voxelization()
 ~ CreateBoundingBox() -> MakeBoundingBox()
 - File IO operations
 - SetModelName(...)

McCadCSGTool_TrivialCheck.{i/j}xx
  - unused bloat-files from OCCT_WOK

McCadCSGTool
  - removed experimental special treatment for tori which increased complexity
    by linking against McCadMcWrite

McCadCSGTool_SignCheck.cxx
  - Removed unused non-member methods Perturb and MakeMcCadSurf
  - junk code
  ! planes mirrored in the origin were recognized as same
  ~ decreased tolerance for point classification (it happened that not enough sample
    points were found)

McCadCSGAdapt_SolidAnalyser
 - removed unused methods
 + added documentation

McCadCSGTool::AppBoxResultants
  - Not used in code hence removed, in this case outcommented because it might be of use in class
    McCadCSGTool_SignCheck

McCadCSGTool_Decomposer
  - removed unused code:
    members:
     myIsTrivial
     myCutState
     myNumberOfSolids
  - methods:
     IsCutSolid()
     IsTrivialSolid()
     NbUnprocessedSolids()

McCadCSGTool_Decomposer
  ~ renamed method ProcessedSolid() to GetProcessedSolid()

McCadCSGTool_Cutter
  - removed unused includes
  - removed unused code:
     PosHalfSpaceSolid()
     NegHalfSpaceSolid()
  - non member junk code:
     HaveSolid()
     RepairOpenShell()

McCadExDll*
 - removed dependencies from QObject

McCadEXPlug_MCBase
 + McCadIOHelper_InputFileParser into PrepareExport()

+ McCadIOHelper_InputFileParser
  added file parser for InputFile for Void Generator - before: file was read and processed in
  McCadConvertTools_VoidGenerator

+ McCadIOHelper_Expander
  moved from McCadConvertTools

+ McCadIOHelper_Merger
  moved from McCadConvertTools

+ McCadIOTools_*
  new tool group from which each class inherits McCadTool_Task to have a unified action control
  from GUI
  + _MCExportBase .. for sign constant decomposition and void generation
  + _ExportBrep
  + _ExportIges
  + _ExportStep
  + _ExportMcnp
  + _ExportTripoli
  + _ImportBrep
  + _ImportIges
  + _ImportMcnp
  + _ImportStep

McCadGUI_*
 ~ removed dependencies from QObject

McCadMessenger_XXX
  Classes for an internal messenger system which requires linking against interfaces only;
  McCadMessenger_Singleton substitutes McCadGUI_Messenger;
  Instances of the singleton can be created in every class in McCad. One can register observers
  inherited from McCadMessenger_ObserverInterface;
  The QMcCad_Application registers a QMcCadMessenger_MainWindowMessenger with the Singleton which
  is linked to the main windows message window.

McCadMcVoid_Generator
 - removed exit statement which was ment for debugging purposes only

McCadTool_TaskID
 + McCadTool_ExportMCBase


Changes to previous version 0.2.1
==================================

- McCadConvertTools_VoidGeneration : removal of obsolete methods
  ::WriteVoidsFile()
  ::WriteModelFile()
  ::WriteMCNPFile()
  ::WriteAll()

+ Adding script to delete files which are unneccessary for shipping
  prepareForShipping

+ example directory
  + two ParameterFiles for McCad, one very detailed with parameter explanation, the other is minimalistic
  + brick.stp - simple example geometry for the first steps in McCad

+ update of the doc/index.html to current state (version 0.2.1, use of oce)

- Removed obsolete McCadMcVoid_Generator::SetMinSolidVolume()
- Removed obsolete McCadMcVoid_Generator::myMinSolidVolume
- Removed obsolete parameter McCadMcVoid_Generator::myMaxSubdivision and related methods
- Removed obsolete parameter McCadMcVoid_Generator::myMaxInShapes and related methods
~ changed McCadMcVoid_Generator::SetTolrenace() to McCadMcVoid_Generator::SetTolerance()
+ added method documentation for McCadMcVoid_Generator

+ added documentation for McCadGTOOL

! McCadCSGTool::BoxResultants()
  trac ticket #8
  In one case two different planar faces must be added to the resultants
  This bug created twice the same plane instead

~ McCadCSGTool_TrivialCheck
  in constructors set 'myIsDone' default to 'false'


~ Reestablishing support for OCC 6.5.0
  To make use of the older release version, e.g. to use precompiled libraries (debian package, readhead package)
  run cmake with the parameters -DOCC650=true i.e.
  > cmake .. -DOCC650=true -DOCC_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/includes -DOCC_LIB_DIR=/path/to/OCClibs

~ McCadConvertTools_Convertor::Convert()
  #3
  changed name of volume control log file from .failedVolumeControl to failedVolumeControl.log
  it didn't make sense to hide this file

~ McCadConvertTools_VoidGenerator
  #5
  writing and reading voxel files to/from subdirectory voxels
  ~ make CollisionFile unhid

~ McCadMcWrite_McnpInputGenerator
  change filename of CAD volumes to CadVolumes
